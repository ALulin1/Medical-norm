# Ethical Guidelines for AI-Driven Medical Systems

## 1. Data Privacy & Security
- All patient data must be anonymized using ISO/TS 25237:2008 standards
- Implement end-to-end encryption meeting GOST R 34.11-2012 requirements
- Maintain audit trails with blockchain-based immutability (Hyperledger Fabric 2.5+)

## 2. Algorithmic Transparency
- Provide model explainability reports per ISO/IEC 23053:2022 framework
- Document decision confidence intervals (95% CI required)
- Maintain version-controlled model registry

## 3. Patient Rights
- Explicit opt-in consent for AI-assisted diagnosis (Article 22 GDPR compliance)

## 8. Cultural Sensitivity
- Localization of medical knowledge bases
- Adjustment for regional clinical practice variations
- Multilingual interface support (minimum 6 UN official languages)

## 9. Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time alerting for ethical boundary violations
- Automated shutdown protocols for critical failures
- Post-market surveillance per FDA 21 CFR Part 803

## 10. Training Requirements
- Mandatory certification for clinical users (20 CME credits/year)
